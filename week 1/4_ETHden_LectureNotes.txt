Lecture 4 - 10/20/22

Solidity is compiled into bytecode. Byte code is used to calculate gas by operation. Some input data can be seen on a smart contract as bytecode.

you should be using inheritance if you want to deploy many contracts in a single file. but in case you are deploying more than 1 independent contract in a single file then the compiler might select only the last one for deployment others will be skipped.

revert is like an event for an error firing

Just be sure to remove the hardhat library when you deploy to mainnet. There's been quite a few contracts that still have it in the contract :/
