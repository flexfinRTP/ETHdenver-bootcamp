Lecture 2 - 10/18/22

data is generall public. We want to show that the tx cam from a tx and the identity is private

conensus client is repsonible for choosing the order of the tx. the execution clinet are the 'miners' that produce the blocks

casper ffg was implemented in the ETH PoS. It sounded like casper from omg was canceled

it takes about 6min for a eth pos validated block to go through

each slot to validate a block, there could be empty slots

there are aggregators that check the validitity of one merkle tree of tx instead of all the tx.

The lbock and data is propogated throughout the network when a smart contract is deplyed

nodes are keeping state of the system in the blockchain, tx's are updating the state and the blocks being syncrohinsly updated, keeps the state in agreement between nodes

smart contract is compiled to bytecode before deploying to the blockchain. (this is the abi?, NO)

Test contract by sending tx to contract to call functions within your contract
